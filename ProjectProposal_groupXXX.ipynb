    "*With the ongoing pandemic, there are many factors that contribute to the rise in Covid-19 cases. For our project, we will be specifically focusing on the state of prisons (funding/security/population/ location) to see if they play a role in covid infection rates among prisoners. Prisoner death rates have increased as of late and the infection rate of prisoners in the United States is four times that of the general public. Those in prison are also highly susceptible to contracting covid and experiencing severe symptoms due to the demographics of prisoners: most prisoners have chronic diseases and underlying health issues that can exacerbate their condition (4). Although prisons have taken preventative measures such as regular cleaning and discontinuation of group activities that present high risk, with the difficulty of having social distancing, the rates of Covid-19 infections and deaths in prisoners are higher than that of the general population (3). Prisoners are at a higher risk of infection due to an increase in the average age of prisoners, many of which have chronic conditions. Due to this, and overpopulation in prisons, prisoners may struggle to access health care or may experience long wait times in an attempt to seek care (1).As a result of the high influx of cases and social distancing standards, many prisons nationwide have been releasing prisoners earlier than their original sentence. * \n",
